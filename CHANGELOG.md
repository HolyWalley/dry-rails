Initial port of dry-system-rails with a couple of new features

### Added

- `:namespaced` auto-register strategy which supports loading components from the typical Rails directory structure but with the assumption that they are properly namespaced, ie: `app/services/github.rb` => `YourApp::Services::Github`
